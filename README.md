Space Efficient RISC Architecture and Instruction Set, a personal project of mine to make a VLE 64-bit RISC architecture.

This is due to the fact that while I have experience licensing software, I do not have experience licensing a patentable concept, like an instruction set. As such, until I figure out a suitable license that won't lead to shenanigins from any party (myself included), I'm retaining all rights.
